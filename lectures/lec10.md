* mutability
* duck typing
* lists
* tuples
* dictionaries
* sets
* probably next is numpy for matrices and vectors, etc...

1. Designing data models and interfaces
   1. Many reason to break project into distinct pieces with well-defined
      interfaces
      * division of labor
      * separation of concerns
      * reviewability
   1. all components must share the same data model
      * how will data be shared among components
      * balance between flexibility and simplicity
      * depends heavily on features of language
        * object-oriented
        * advanced containers
   1. define interfaces
      * input, output, behavior
